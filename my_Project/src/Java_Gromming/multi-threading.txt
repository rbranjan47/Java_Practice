Multi-Threading:
Multi-Threading is a concept of JAVA that allows concurrent execution of two or
more parts of program for maximum utilization of CPU. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
start() method is used for creation of new Thread, while 
run() method id used for runnig the new Created Thread.

We can't call start() method twice otherwise it will throw illegalStateException.
But, we can call run() method multiple times.
Each parts of such program are called as THREAD.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can implement thread, by 2 methods;
a. By extanding the thread
b. by implementing Runnable Iterface

If we extend Thread class, we can't extend other class as java doesn't support 
   multiple inheritance.
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting and Setting Name of the Thread
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thread Priorities, depends on its state:
1. New 
2. Runnable
3. Blocked
4. Waiting
5. Timed Waiting
6. Terminated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Thread:
When Java program starts running usally 1 Thread starts run automatically, this 
is called as main Thread.

To Stop the automatic execution of main Thread, we can use Current Thread() method.

3 types of Thread-Priority:
public static int MIN_PRIORITY, minimum priority having value 1
public static int NORM_PRIORITY, default priority having default value i.e. 5
public static int MAX_PRIORITY, maximum priority having value 10

The method to prevent Thread;
a. yeild()
b. join()
c. sleep()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interthread communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dead-lock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deamon Threads
Daemon thread is a service provider, which provides service to running threads.

For Example, Finalizer thread is running automatically to kill all the running 
             threads in after complete execution of a program.
